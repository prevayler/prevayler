            Please create a new issue in PicoContainer's JIRA:
            http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=NOTCREATEDYET
            Then attach the patch.txt file.
            If your patch consists of entirely new files too, please zip them
            up and attach them too.

            If your patch includes JUnit tests and a decent description,
            you increase the chance of having the patch applied by some
            of the committers.
