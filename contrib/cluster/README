EXPERIMENTAL CODE! Spike for implementing a clustered homogenous (i.e. without a master) Prevayler using JavaGroups
For example, the clock is *not* properly synchronized across the cluster
This code will be thrown away when the real implementation is created

Hi y'all,

We (me and the guys at Lecando) have spiked a clustered Prevayler implementation using JavaGroups. It's quite ugly
and doesn't work very well, but it illustrates one way of doing it. It's a homogenous cluster, i.e. there is no master.

The strategy is:
 - When a transaction is executed a distributed lock is acquired, the transaction is then multicasted/broadcasted to
 the entire cluster.
 - Each node logs it's transactions to disk individually.
 - When a new node joins a cluster the lock is once again acquired and the entire system is sent to the new node from
 one of the other nodes. The old transaction logs of that system is moved aside and a snapshot is take of the system.
 - If there are no existing nodes the system is restarted from the transaction logs on disk.
 - All communication is using IP multicast so the network usage could, in theory, be optimal and could scale to any
 number of cluster nodes.
 - Transaction execution time *is* sent as part of the transaction, but it is not currently used.
 - It's implemented as a decorator to an existing Prevayler, a design that seemed to be working at first, but when
 doing it for real it should probably be implemented as a TransactionPublisher.

It's in contrib/cluster.

Have a look, be inspired, but *don't* use it for real! You've been warned... :-)

Cheers,
