Here is the code for batching writes. As I mentioned earlier, I threw it together as a proof of concept. We are using currently while perf testing our app so its been exercised a bit but it hasn't been to production yet...

Quick Notes
-----------
1) All changes were in the org.prevayler.implementation package
2) Added class BatchedCommandOutputStream. This is a replacement for CommandOutputStream.
3) Added ExecuteCommandThread.
4) Added some -D options in BatchedCommandOutputStream which I found useful while perf tuning. They are:
	a) PrevaylerMaxWriteBatchSize - This will ensure that no more than this number of commands are written to disk in once "commit". In theory, useful to control latency. Defaults to 1000.
	b) PrevaylerLogFileSize - what size to roll the log file at. Defaults to 5MB.
	c) PrevaylerGzipOutput - whether to Gzip the output stream for smaller logs files and writes. Useful if you got CPU to burn. Defaults to true.
	d) PrevaylerAsyncExecute - whether to execute commands on a dedicated ExecuteCommandThread. Explained further below. Defaults to true.
5) Changed the way clock interacts w/ system.
6) Implementation is a little messy, too many objects are interacting w/ other objects (high coupling). This was because I was trying to avoid refactoring the current layout...

Overview
--------

Put your threading helmets on, never have you seen the synchronized keyword so heavily abused! ;-)

When a command is executed the BatchedCommandOutputStream's
writeAndExecuteCommand(Command) method is called. It wraps the command in a ClockRecoveryCommand and puts it on the writeCommandToDiskQueue which is serviced by the BatchedCommandOutputStream's internal thread. Using wait & notify the write thread is notified and begins to write whatever is on the queue to disk. The application thread (calling thread) then executes a
wait() on the command it wants results for.

When the disk write completes the thread will pass on the commands written to disk to the ExecuteCommandThread. The ExecuteCommandThread (poorly named since its not always a thread) either executes the commands immediately or puts them in its internal queue to be processed by its own thread (depending on -DPrevaylerAsyncExecute's value. Default is to execute on its thread). Using a separate thread for executing helps maximize CPU usage since commands execute while writing is in progress.

The BatchedCommandOutputStream and ExecuteCommandThread share 2 maps. One for return values and one for exceptions. The ExecuteCommandThread puts values in these maps using the command as the key and return value or Exception as a value. The ExecuteCommandThread then calls notify on the command object it just executed letting the application thread know that the disk write is complete and there is a return result or exception in one of the 2 maps.

Hope this makes sense! Its late and I'm tired so who knows...

Regards,
Robin

I think it actually gives us credibility to say that
we are a bit slower than MySQL in at least one
criterium.

Technically, though, it is better for Prevayler to be
faster, of course.

I'll wait for the code.

See you, Klaus.
