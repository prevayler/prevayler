/**
 * An atomic transaction to be executed on a PrevalentSystem. Any operation which changes the
 * observable state of a PrevalentSystem must be encapsulated as a Command.
 * 
 * This command adds the capability to create mementos of objects before they get modified. In
 * the event of a failure, these mementos are restored and the system is left in the state it
 * was in before the command got executed.
 * 
 * The execution is split in four parts:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Find the objects: find all the objects needed for checking the precondition, creating
 *  the mementos and execution, and store them in transient fields;</li>
 *  <li>Check the precondition: verify that it is safe to execute;</li>
 *  <li>Create the mementos: create a memento for each object that is possibly going to be modified;</li>
 *  <li>Execute: modify the objects.</li>
 * </ul>
