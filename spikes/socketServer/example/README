The socketServer is a command-line client-server application
demonstrating how to use the prevayler.socketServer framework.  It
illustrates how to send Transasctions to a remote Prevayler server and
shows how to process callbacks sent by remote business objects.  (If
you run two simultaneous instances of the client, all clients will
automatically update their displays when any client changes the data
in the server.)


Running the server
------------------

1) Make sure Config.ini is in the current working directory.  If you
want or need to change the TCP port number used by the server, do it
here.

2) Add Prevayler plus the examples to your classpath.

On Windows, my classpath is:

set CLASSPATH="c:\eclipse2\workspace\prevayler\bin"

Note that since I am using Eclipse to build Prevayler and the demo,
${prevayler}\bin is the root of the entire Prevayler classpath,
including that of the demo.  If you use Ant or Maven to build
Prevayler, you may have to adjust this.  Minimally, you will need
Prevayler plus the socketServer's server and transactions folders and
the example's server and transactions folders.

3) Run the server using the following command:

java org.prevayler.socketserver.server.Main


Running the client
------------------

1) Make sure Todo.ini is in the current working directory.

2) If you are using Eclipse to build Prevayler, you can use the same
classpath as the server.  Otherwise, make sure your classpath contains
Prevayler, the socketServer's client and transactions folders, and the
example's client and transactions folders.

3) Run the client using the following command:

java org.prevayler.socketserver.example.client.Main
