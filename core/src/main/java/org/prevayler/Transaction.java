/** An atomic Transaction to be executed on a Prevalent System. Any operation which changes the observable state of a prevalent system must be encapsulated as a Transaction. <br><br> IMPORTANT: Transactions CANNOT reference business objects directly. Instead, they must search the business objects they need given the Prevalent System. See org.prevayler.demos for usage examples. <br><br> Business objects referenced in a transaction will be mere copies of the original business objects when that transaction is recovered from the serialized journal file. This will make the transactions work when they are executed for the first time but have no effect during shutdown recovery. This is known as the prevalence baptism problem because everyone comes across it, despite of this warning.
