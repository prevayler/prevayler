    // _objectsSynced, so this thread goes right ahead to sync its own
    // object alone. But then, if another thread comes along and writes
    // another object while this thread is syncing, it will write to the
    // _active buffer and then promply block on the _syncLock until this
    // thread finishes the sync. If threads continue to come in at just
    // about the rate that syncs can happen, each thread will wait for the
    // previous sync to complete and then initiate its own sync. The
    // latency for the first thread is exactly the time for one sync, which
    // is the minimum possible latency; the latency for any later thread is
    // somewhere between that minimum and a maximum of two syncs, with the
    // average being closer to the minimum end.
    //
    // Now, consider the steady state under heavy load. Some thread will
    // always be syncing the _inactive buffer to disk, so every thread that
    // arrives will write its object to the _active buffer and then wait
    // here on the _syncLock. If 10 threads arrive during a given sync
    // operation, then _active will hold 10 objects when that sync
    // completes. As soon as that earlier thread releases _syncLock, one of
    // those 10 new threads will acquire the lock and notice that its
    // object has not yet been synced; it will then swap the buffers and
    // flush and sync all 10 objects at once. Each of the 10 threads will
    // acquire _syncLock in turn and now see that their object has already
